class DefaultChannel(ChannelDB, metaclass=TypeclassBase):
    r"""
    This is the base class for all Channel Comms. Inherit from this to
    create different types of communication channels.

    Class-level variables:
    - `send_to_online_only` (bool, default True) - if set, will only try to
      send to subscribers that are actually active. This is a useful optimization.
    - `log_file` (str, default `"channel_{channelname}.log"`). This is the
      log file to which the channel history will be saved. The `{channelname}` tag
      will be replaced by the key of the Channel. If an Attribute 'log_file'
      is set, this will be used instead. If this is None and no Attribute is found,
      no history will be saved.
    - `channel_prefix_string` (str, default `"[{channelname} ]"`) - this is used
      as a simple template to get the channel prefix with `.channel_prefix()`. It is used
      in front of every channel message; use `{channelmessage}` token to insert the
      name of the current channel. Set to `None` if you want no prefix (or want to
      handle it in a hook during message generation instead.
    - `channel_msg_nick_pattern`(str, default `"{alias}\s*?|{alias}\s+?(?P<arg1>.+?)") -
      this is what used when a channel subscriber gets a channel nick assigned to this
      channel. The nickhandler uses the pattern to pick out this channel's name from user
      input. The `{alias}` token will get both the channel's key and any set/custom aliases
      per subscriber. You need to allow for an `<arg1>` regex group to catch any message
      that should be send to the  channel. You usually don't need to change this pattern
      unless you are changing channel command-style entirely.
    - `channel_msg_nick_replacement` (str, default `"channel {channelname} = $1"` - this
      is used by the nickhandler to generate a replacement string once the nickhandler (using
      the `channel_msg_nick_pattern`) identifies that the channel should be addressed
      to send a message to it. The `<arg1>` regex pattern match from `channel_msg_nick_pattern`
      will end up at the `$1` position in the replacement. Together, this allows you do e.g.
      'public Hello' and have that become a mapping to `channel public = Hello`. By default,
      the account-level `channel` command is used. If you were to rename that command you must
      tweak the output to something like `yourchannelcommandname {channelname} = $1`.

    * Properties:
        mutelist
        banlist
        wholist

    * Working methods:
        get_log_filename()
        set_log_filename(filename)
        has_connection(account) - check if the given account listens to this channel
        connect(account) - connect account to this channel
        disconnect(account) - disconnect account from channel
        access(access_obj, access_type='listen', default=False) - check the
                    access on this channel (default access_type is listen)
        create(key, creator=None, *args, **kwargs)
        delete() - delete this channel
        message_transform(msg, emit=False, prefix=True,
                          sender_strings=None, external=False) - called by
                          the comm system and triggers the hooks below
        msg(msgobj, header=None, senders=None, sender_strings=None,
            persistent=None, online=False, emit=False, external=False) - main
                send method, builds and sends a new message to channel.
        tempmsg(msg, header=None, senders=None) - wrapper for sending non-persistent
                messages.
        distribute_message(msg, online=False) - send a message to all
                connected accounts on channel, optionally sending only
                to accounts that are currently online (optimized for very large sends)
        mute(subscriber, **kwargs)
        unmute(subscriber, **kwargs)
        ban(target, **kwargs)
        unban(target, **kwargs)
        add_user_channel_alias(user, alias, **kwargs)
        remove_user_channel_alias(user, alias, **kwargs)


    Useful hooks:
        at_channel_creation() - called once, when the channel is created
        basetype_setup()
        at_init()
        at_first_save()
        channel_prefix() - how the channel should be
                  prefixed when returning to user. Returns a string
        format_senders(senders) - should return how to display multiple
                senders to a channel
        pose_transform(msg, sender_string) - should detect if the
                sender is posing, and if so, modify the string
        format_external(msg, senders, emit=False) - format messages sent
                from outside the game, like from IRC
        format_message(msg, emit=False) - format the message body before
                displaying it to the user. 'emit' generally means that the
                message should not be displayed with the sender's name.
        channel_prefix()

        pre_join_channel(joiner) - if returning False, abort join
        post_join_channel(joiner) - called right after successful join
        pre_leave_channel(leaver) - if returning False, abort leave
        post_leave_channel(leaver) - called right after successful leave
        at_pre_msg(message, **kwargs)
        at_post_msg(message, **kwargs)

        Add a personal user-alias for this channel to a given subscriber.

        Args:
            user (Object or Account): The one to alias this channel.
            alias (str): The desired alias.

        Note:
            This is tightly coupled to the default `channel` command. If you
            change that, you need to change this as well.

            We add two nicks - one is a plain `alias -> channel.key` that
            users need to be able to reference this channel easily. The other
            is a templated nick to easily be able to send messages to the
            channel without needing to give the full `channel` command. The
            structure of this nick is given by `self.channel_msg_nick_pattern`
            and `self.channel_msg_nick_replacement`. By default it maps
            `alias <msg> -> channel <channelname> = <msg>`, so that you can
            for example just write `pub Hello` to send a message.

            The alias created is `alias $1 -> channel channel = $1`, to allow
            for sending to channel using the main channel command.
