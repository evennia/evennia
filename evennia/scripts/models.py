"""
Scripts are entities that perform some sort of action, either only
once or repeatedly. They can be directly linked to a particular
Evennia Object or be stand-alonw (in the latter case it is considered
a 'global' script). Scripts can indicate both actions related to the
game world as well as pure behind-the-scenes events and effects.
Everything that has a time component in the game (i.e. is not
hard-coded at startup or directly created/controlled by players) is
handled by Scripts.

Scripts have to check for themselves that they should be applied at a
particular moment of time; this is handled by the is_valid() hook.
Scripts can also implement at_start and at_end hooks for preparing and
cleaning whatever effect they have had on the game object.

Common examples of uses of Scripts:

- Load the default cmdset to the account object's cmdhandler
  when logging in.
- Switch to a different state, such as entering a text editor,
  start combat or enter a dark room.
- Merge a new cmdset with the default one for changing which
  commands are available at a particular time
- Give the account/object a time-limited bonus/effect

      typeclass - auto-linked typeclass

      desc - optional description of script
      obj - the object the script is linked to, if any
      account - the account the script is linked to (exclusive with obj)
      interval - how often script should run
      start_delay - if the script should start repeating right away
      repeats - how many times the script should repeat
      persistent - if script should survive a server reboot
      is_active - bool if script is currently running
