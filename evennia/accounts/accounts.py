    the person playing the game and tracks account info, password
    etc. They are OOC entities without presence in-game. An Account
    can connect to a Character Object in order to "enter" the
    game.

    Account Typeclass API:

    * Available properties (only available on initiated typeclass objects)

     - key (string) - name of account
     - name (string)- wrapper for user.username
     - aliases (list of strings) - aliases to the object. Will be saved to
            database as AliasDB entries but returned as strings.
     - dbref (int, read-only) - unique #id-number. Also "id" can be used.
     - date_created (string) - time stamp of object creation
     - permissions (list of strings) - list of permission strings
     - user (User, read-only) - django User authorization object
     - obj (Object) - game object controlled by account. 'character' can also
                     be used.
     - is_superuser (bool, read-only) - if the connected user is a superuser

    * Handlers

     - locks - lock-handler: use locks.add() to add new lock strings
     - db - attribute-handler: store/retrieve database attributes on this
                              self.db.myattr=val, val=self.db.myattr
     - ndb - non-persistent attribute handler: same as db but does not
                                  create a database entry when storing data
     - scripts - script-handler. Add new scripts to object with scripts.add()
     - cmdset - cmdset-handler. Use cmdset.add() to add new cmdsets to object
     - nicks - nick-handler. New nicks with nicks.add().
     - sessions - session-handler. Use session.get() to see all sessions connected, if any
     - options - option-handler. Defaults are taken from settings.OPTIONS_ACCOUNT_DEFAULT
     - characters - handler for listing the account's playable characters
