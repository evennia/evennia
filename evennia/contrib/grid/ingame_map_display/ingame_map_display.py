Basic Map - helpme 2022

This adds an ascii `map` to a given room which can be viewed with the `map` command.
You can easily alter it to add special characters, room colors etc. The map shown is
dynamically generated on use, and supports all compass directions and up/down. Other
directions are ignored.

If you don't expect the map to be updated frequently, you could choose to save the
calculated map as a .ndb value on the room and render that instead of running mapping
calculations anew each time.

An example map:
```
       |
     -[-]-
       |
       |
-[-]--[-]--[-]--[-]
  |    |    |    |
       |    |    |
     -[-]--[-]  [-]
       | \/ |    |
     \ | /\ |
     -[-]--[-]
```

Installation:

Adding the `MapDisplayCmdSet` to the default character cmdset will add the `map` command.

Specifically, in `mygame/commands/default_cmdsets.py`:

```
...
from evennia.contrib.grid.ingame_map_display import MapDisplayCmdSet  # <---

class CharacterCmdset(default_cmds.Character_CmdSet):
    ...
    def at_cmdset_creation(self):
        ...
        self.add(MapDisplayCmdSet)  # <---

```

Then `reload` to make the new commands available.

Additional Settings:

In order to change your default map size, you can add to `mygame/server/settings.py`:

BASIC_MAP_SIZE = 5

This changes the default map width/height. 2-5 for most clients is sensible.

If you don't want the player to be able to specify the size of the map, ignore any
arguments passed into the Map command.
