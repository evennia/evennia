"""
Evennia Talkative NPC

Contribution - Griatch 2011, grungies1138, 2016

This is a static NPC object capable of holding a simple menu-driven
conversation. It's just meant as an example.

Installation:

Create the NPC by creating an object of typeclass `contrib.tutorials.talking_npc.TalkingNPC`,
For example:

    create/drop John : contrib.tutorials.talking_npc.TalkingNPC

Use `talk` in the same room as the NPC to start a conversation.

If there are many talkative npcs in the same room you will get to
choose which one's talk command to call (Evennia handles this
automatically). This use of EvMenu is very simplistic; See EvMenu for
a lot more complex possibilities.
