    Inherit from this if you want to create your own command styles

    the command, so make sure to document consistently here.

    Each Command implements the following methods, called
    in this order (only func() is actually required):
        - at_pre_cmd(): If this returns True, execution is aborted.
        - parse(): Should perform any extra parsing needed on self.args
            and store the result on self.
        - func(): Performs the actual work.
        - at_post_cmd(): Extra actions, often things done after
            every command, like prompts.

#            self.key - the name of this command ('look')

#
#            self.caller - the object calling this command
#            self.cmdstring - the actual command name used to call this
#                             (this allows you to know which alias was used,
#                              for example)
#            self.args - the raw input; everything following self.cmdstring.
#            self.cmdset - the cmdset from which this command was picked. Not
#                          often used (useful for commands like 'help' or to
#                          list all available commands etc)
#            self.obj - the object on which this command was defined. It is often
#                          the same as self.caller.

#
#           name[ with several words][/switch[/switch..]] arg1[,arg2,...] [[=|,] arg[,..]]
#
#         The 'name[ with several words]' part is already dealt with by the
#         cmdhandler at this point, and stored in self.cmdname (we don't use
#         it here). The rest of the command is stored in self.args, which can
#         start with the switch indicator /.
#
#         This parser breaks self.args into its constituents and stores them in the
#         following variables:

#           self.raw = This is the raw argument input, including switches
