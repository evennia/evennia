Command sets

All commands in the game must be grouped in a cmdset.  A given command
can be part of any number of cmdsets and cmdsets can be added/removed
and merged onto entities at runtime.

To create new commands to populate the cmdset, see
`commands/command.py`.

This module wraps the default command sets of Evennia; overloads them
to add/remove commands from the default lineup. You can create your
own cmdsets by inheriting from them or directly from `evennia.CmdSet`.
