MCCP - Mud Client Compression Protocol

This implements the MCCP v2 telnet protocol as per
http://tintin.sourceforge.net/mccp/. MCCP allows for the server to
compress data when sending to supporting clients, reducing bandwidth
by 70-90%.. The compression is done using Python's builtin zlib
library. If the client doesn't support MCCP, server sends uncompressed
as normal.  Note: On modern hardware you are not likely to notice the
effect of MCCP unless you have extremely heavy traffic or sits on a
terribly slow connection.

This protocol is implemented by the telnet protocol importing
mccp_compress and calling it from its write methods.
