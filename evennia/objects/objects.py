# Base class to inherit from.


class DefaultObject(ObjectDB, metaclass=TypeclassBase):
    """
    This is the root Object typeclass, representing all entities that
    have an actual presence in-game. DefaultObjects generally have a
    location. They can also be manipulated and looked at. Game
    entities you define should inherit from DefaultObject at some distance.

    It is recommended to create children of this class using the
    `evennia.create_object()` function rather than to initialize the class
    directly - this will both set things up and efficiently save the object
    without `obj.save()` having to be called explicitly.

    Note: Check the autodocs for complete class members, this may not always
    be up-to date.

    * Base properties defined/available on all Objects

     key (string) - name of object
     name (string)- same as key
     dbref (int, read-only) - unique #id-number. Also "id" can be used.
     date_created (string) - time stamp of object creation

     account (Account) - controlling account (if any, only set together with
                       sessid below)
     sessid (int, read-only) - session id (if any, only set together with
                       account above). Use `sessions` handler to get the
                       Sessions directly.
     location (Object) - current location. Is None if this is a room
     home (Object) - safety start-location
     has_account (bool, read-only)- will only return *connected* accounts
     contents (list, read only) - returns all objects inside this object
     exits (list of Objects, read-only) - returns all exits from this
                       object, if any
     destination (Object) - only set if this object is an exit.
     is_superuser (bool, read-only) - True/False if this user is a superuser
     is_connected (bool, read-only) - True if this object is associated with
                            an Account with any connected sessions.
     has_account (bool, read-only) - True is this object has an associated account.
     is_superuser (bool, read-only): True if this object has an account and that
                        account is a superuser.
     plural_category (string) - Alias category for the plural strings of this object

    * Handlers available

     aliases - alias-handler: use aliases.add/remove/get() to use.
     permissions - permission-handler: use permissions.add/remove() to
                   add/remove new perms.
     locks - lock-handler: use locks.add() to add new lock strings
     scripts - script-handler. Add new scripts to object with scripts.add()
     cmdset - cmdset-handler. Use cmdset.add() to add new cmdsets to object
     nicks - nick-handler. New nicks with nicks.add().
     sessions - sessions-handler. Get Sessions connected to this
                object with sessions.get()
     attributes - attribute-handler. Use attributes.add/remove/get.
     db - attribute-handler: Shortcut for attribute-handler. Store/retrieve
            database attributes using self.db.myattr=val, val=self.db.myattr
     ndb - non-persistent attribute handler: same as db but does not create
            a database entry when storing data

     basetype_setup()     - only called once, used for behind-the-scenes
                            setup. Normally not modified.
     basetype_posthook_setup() - customization in basetype, after the object
                            has been created; Normally not modified.

     at_object_creation() - only called once, when object is first created.
                            Object customizations go here.
     at_object_post_creation() - only called once, when object is first created.
                            Additional setup involving e.g. prototype-set attributes can go here.
     at_object_delete() - called just before deleting an object. If returning
                            False, deletion is aborted. Note that all objects
                            inside a deleted object are automatically moved
                            to their <home>, they don't need to be removed here.
     at_object_post_spawn() - called when object is spawned from a prototype or updated
                            by the spawner to apply prototype changes.
     at_init()            - called whenever typeclass is cached from memory,

                            not normally used unless the cmdset is created
                            dynamically (see e.g. Exits).
     at_pre_puppet(account)- (account-controlled objects only) called just
                            before puppeting

     at_pre_move(destination)             - called just before moving object
                        to the destination. If returns False, move is cancelled.
     announce_move_from(destination)         - called in old location, just
                        before move, if obj.move_to() has quiet=False
     announce_move_to(source_location)       - called in new location, just

     at_post_traverse(traversing_object, source_location) - (exit-objects only)
                              called just after a traversal has happened.
     at_failed_traverse(traversing_object)      - (exit-objects only) called if

        Perform a standard object search in the database, handling
        multiple results and lack thereof gracefully. By default, only
        objects in the current `location` of `self` or its inventory are searched for.

        Args:
            searchdata (str or obj): Primary search criterion. Will be matched
                against `object.key` (with `object.aliases` second) unless
                the keyword attribute_name specifies otherwise.

                Special keywords:

                - `#<num>`: search by unique dbref. This is always a global search.
                - `me,self`: self-reference to this object
                - `<num>-<string>` - can be used to differentiate
                   between multiple same-named matches. The exact form of this input
                   is given by `settings.SEARCH_MULTIMATCH_REGEX`.

            global_search (bool): Search all objects globally. This overrules 'location' data.
            use_nicks (bool): Use nickname-replace (nicktype "object") on `searchdata`.
            typeclass (str or Typeclass, or list of either): Limit search only
                to `Objects` with this typeclass. May be a list of typeclasses
                for a broader search.
            location (Object or list): Specify a location or multiple locations
                to search. Note that this is used to query the *contents* of a
                location and will not match for the location itself -
                if you want that, don't set this or use `candidates` to specify
                exactly which objects should be searched. If this nor candidates are
                given, candidates will include caller's inventory, current location and
                all objects in the current location.
            attribute_name (str): Define which property to search. If set, no
                key+alias search will be performed. This can be used
                to search database fields (db_ will be automatically
                prepended), and if that fails, it will try to return
                objects having Attributes with this name and value
                equal to searchdata. A special use is to search for
                "key" here if you want to do a key-search without
                including aliases.
            quiet (bool): don't display default error messages - this tells the
                search method that the user wants to handle all errors
                themselves. It also changes the return value type, see
                below.
            exact (bool): if unset (default) - prefers to match to beginning of
                string rather than not matching at all. If set, requires
                exact matching of entire string.
            candidates (list of objects): this is an optional custom list of objects
                to search (filter) between. It is ignored if `global_search`
                is given. If not set, this list will automatically be defined
                to include the location, the contents of location and the
                caller's contents (inventory).
            use_locks (bool): If True (default) - removes search results which
                fail the "search" lock.
            nofound_string (str):  optional custom string for not-found error message.
            multimatch_string (str): optional custom string for multimatch error header.
            use_dbref (bool or None, optional): If `True`, allow to enter e.g. a query "#123"
                to find an object (globally) by its database-id 123. If `False`, the string "#123"
                will be treated like a normal string. If `None` (default), the ability to query by
                #dbref is turned on if `self` has the permission 'Builder' and is turned off
                otherwise.
            tags (list or tuple): Find objects matching one or more Tags. This should be one or
                more tag definitions on the form `tagname` or `(tagname, tagcategory)`.
            stacked (int, optional): If > 0, multimatches will be analyzed to determine if they
                only contains identical objects; these are then assumed 'stacked' and no multi-match
                error will be generated, instead `stacked` number of matches will be returned as a
                list. If `stacked` is larger than number of matches, returns that number of matches.
                If the found stack is a mix of objects, return None and handle the multi-match error
                depending on the value of `quiet`.

        Returns:
            Object, None or list: Will return an `Object` or `None` if `quiet=False`. Will return
            a `list` with 0, 1 or more matches if `quiet=True`. If `stacked` is a positive integer,
            this list may contain all stacked identical matches.

        Notes:
            To find Accounts, use eg. `evennia.account_search`. If
            `quiet=False`, error messages will be handled by
            `settings.SEARCH_AT_RESULT` and echoed automatically (on
            error, return will be `None`). If `quiet=True`, the error
            messaging is assumed to be handled by the caller.

        Keyword Args:
            Other keyword arguments will be added to the found command
            object instace as variables before it executes.  This is
            unused by default Evennia but may be used to set flags and
            change operating paramaters for commands at run-time.

        Returns:
            Deferred: This is an asynchronous Twisted object that
            will not fire until the command has actually finished
            executing. To overload this one needs to attach
            callback functions to it, with addCallback(function).
            This function will be called with an eventual return
            value from the command execution. This return is not
            used at all by Evennia by default, but might be useful
            for coders intending to implement some sort of nested
            command structure.

                inline function callables.

            mapping (dict, optional): A mapping of formatting keys
                `{"key":<object>, "key2":<object2>,...}.
                The keys must either match `{key}` or `$You(key)/$you(key)` markers

            raise_funcparse_errors (bool, optional): If set, a failing `$func()` will
                lead to an outright error. If unset (default), the failing `$func()`
                will instead appear in output unparsed.

            **kwargs: Keyword arguments will be passed on to `obj.msg()` for all
                messaged objects.

        Notes:
            For 'actor-stance' reporting (You say/Name says), use the
            `$You()/$you()/$You(key)` and `$conj(verb)` (verb-conjugation)
            inline callables. This will use the respective `get_display_name()`
            for all onlookers except for `from_obj or self`, which will become
            'You/you'. If you use `$You/you(key)`, the key must be in `mapping`.

            For 'director-stance' reporting (Name says/Name says), use {key}
            syntax directly. For both `{key}` and `You/you(key)`,
            `mapping[key].get_display_name(looker=recipient)` may be called
            depending on who the recipient is.

        Examples:

            Let's assume:

            - `player1.key` -> "Player1",
            - `player1.get_display_name(looker=player2)` -> "The First girl"
            - `player2.key` -> "Player2",
            - `player2.get_display_name(looker=player1)` -> "The Second girl"

            Actor-stance:
            ::

                char.location.msg_contents(

            - player1 will see `You attack The Second girl.`

        Moves this object to a new location.

        Args:

                can also be an exit object, in which case the

            quiet (bool): If true, turn off the calling of the emit hooks
                (announce_move_to/from etc)
            emit_to_obj (DefaultObject): object to receive error messages
            use_destination (bool): Default is for objects to use the "destination"
                 property of destinations as the target to move to. Turning off this
                 keyword allows objects to move "inside" exit objects.
            to_none (bool): Allow destination to be None. Note that no hooks are run when
                 moving to a None location. If you want to run hooks, run them manually
                 (and make sure they can manage None locations).
            move_hooks (bool): If False, turn off the calling of move-related hooks
                (at_pre/post_move etc) with quiet=True, this is as quiet a move
                as can be done.
            move_type (str): The "kind of move" being performed, such as "teleport", "traverse",
                "get", "give", or "drop". The value can be arbitrary. By default, it only affects
                the text message generated by announce_move_to and announce_move_from by defining
                their {"type": move_type} for outgoing text. This can be used for altering
                messages and/or overloaded hook behaviors.
            **kwargs: Passed on to all movement- and announcement hooks. Use in your game to let
                hooks know about any special condition of the move (such as running or sneaking).
                Exits will pass an "exit_obj" kwarg.

        Returns:
            bool: True/False depending on if there were problems with the move. This method may also
            return various error messages to the `emit_to_obj`.

            No access checks are done in this method, these should be handled before

        re-writing it completely.

        Args:
            message (str): The message to convey.
            msg_self (bool or str, optional): If boolean True, echo `message` to self. If a string,
                return that message. If False or unset, don't echo to self.
            msg_location (str, optional): The message to echo to self's location.
            receivers (DefaultObject or iterable, optional): An eventual receiver or receivers of the
                message (by default only used by whispers).
            msg_receivers(str): Specific message to pass to the receiver(s). This will parsed
                with the {receiver} placeholder replaced with the given receiver.
        Keyword Args:
            whisper (bool): If this is a whisper rather than a say. Kwargs
                can be used by other verbal commands in a similar way.
            mapping (dict): Pass an additional mapping to the message.

        Notes:


            Messages can contain {} markers. These are substituted against the values
            passed in the `mapping` argument.
