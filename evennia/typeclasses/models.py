"""
This is the *abstract* django models for many of the database objects
in Evennia. A django abstract (obs, not the same as a Python metaclass!) is
a model which is not actually created in the database, but which only exists
for other models to inherit from, to avoid code duplication. Any model can
import and inherit from these classes.

Attributes are database objects stored on other objects. The implementing
class needs to supply a ForeignKey field attr_object pointing to the kind
of object being mapped. Attributes storing iterables actually store special
types of iterables named PackedList/PackedDict respectively. These make
sure to save changes to them to database - this is criticial in order to
allow for obj.db.mylist[2] = data. Also, all dbobjects are saved as
dbrefs but are also aggressively cached.

TypedObjects are objects 'decorated' with a typeclass - that is, the typeclass
(which is a normal Python class implementing some special tricks with its
get/set attribute methods, allows for the creation of all sorts of different
objects all with the same database object underneath. Usually attributes are
used to permanently store things not hard-coded as field on the database object.
The admin should usually not have to deal directly  with the database object
layer.

This module also contains the Managers for the respective models; inherit from
these to create custom managers.
