```warning::

  This is the **experimental** and **unstable** documentation for the
  development branch of Evennia (v1.0-dev). It's based on converted docs
  from the Evennia wiki (https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/) at
  2020-06-12 22:36:53. There are known conversion issues and missing links.
  This will slowly be ironed out as this is developed.

  For now you are best off using the original wiki, or the less changing v0.9.1
  of these docs. You have been warned.
