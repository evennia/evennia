### Literature

- Richard Bartle *Designing Virtual Worlds*
  ([amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Virtual-Worlds-Richard-Bartle/dp/0131018167)) -
  Essential reading for the design of any persistent game
  world, written by the co-creator of the original game *MUD*. Published in 2003 but it's still as
  relevant now as when it came out. Covers everything you need to know and then some.

  When the rights to Designing Virtual Worlds returned to him, Richard Bartle
  made the PDF of his Designing Virtual Worlds freely available through his own
  website ([Designing Virtual Worlds](https://mud.co.uk/dvw/)). A direct link to
  the PDF can be found [here](https://mud.co.uk/richard/DesigningVirtualWorlds.pdf).
- David M. Beazley *Python Essential Reference (4th ed)*
  ([amazon page](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-David-Beazley/dp/0672329786/)) -
  Our recommended book on Python; it not only efficiently summarizes the language but is also
  an excellent reference to the standard library for more experienced Python coders.
- Luciano Ramalho, *Fluent Python*
  ([O'Reilly page](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do)) -
  This is an excellent book for experienced Python coders willing to take their code to the next level.
  A great read with a lot of useful info also for veteran Pythonistas.
- Richard Cantillon *An Essay on Economic Theory*
  ([free pdf](https://mises.org/books/essay_on_economic_theory_cantillon.pdf)) - A very good English
  translation of *Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général*, one of the foundations of modern
  economic theory. Written in 1730 but the translation is annotated and the essay is actually very
  easy to follow also for a modern reader. Required reading if you think of implementing a sane game
  economic system.
