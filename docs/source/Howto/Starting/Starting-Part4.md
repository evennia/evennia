# Evennia Starting Tutorial (Part 4)

```sidebar:: Tutorial Parts

  Part 1: `What we have <./Starting-Part1.html>`_
    A tour of Evennia and how to use the tools, including an introduction to Python.
  Part 2: `What we want <./Starting-Part2.html>`_
    Planning our tutorial game and what to think about when planning your own in the future.
  Part 3: `How we get there <./Starting-Part3.html>`_ 
       Getting down to the meat of extending Evennia to make our game to make a tech-demo
  **Part 4: Using what we created**
    Using the tech-demo and world content to go with our code
  Part 5: `Showing the world <./Starting-Part5.html>`_
    Taking our new game online and let players try it out
``` 

We now have the code underpinnings of everything we need. We have also tested the various components 
and has a simple tech-demo to show it all works together. But there is no real coherence to it at this
point - we need to actually make a world. 
In part four we will expand our tech demo into a more full-fledged (if small) game by use of batchcommand
and batchcode processors.
