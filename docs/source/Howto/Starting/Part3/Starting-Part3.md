    Planning our tutorial game and what to think about when planning your own in the future.
  **Part 3: How we get there**
       Getting down to the meat of extending Evennia to make our game
  Part 4: `Using what we created <./Starting-Part4.html>`_
    Building a tech-demo and world content to go with our code
  Part 5: `Showing the world <./Starting-Part5.html>`_
    Taking our new game online and let players try it out
```
In part three of the Evennia Starting tutorial we will go through the creation of several key parts 
of our tutorial game _EvAdventure_. As we go, we will test each part and create a simple "tech demo" to 
show off all the moving parts. 

1. [Changing settings](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Applying contribs](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Creating a rule module](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Tweaking the base Typeclasses](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Character creation menu](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Wearing armor and wielding weapons](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Two types of combat](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Monsters and AI](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Questing and rewards](../../../Unimplemented)
1. [Overview of Tech demo](../../../Unimplemented)

If you followed the previous parts of this tutorial you will have some notions about Python and where to find
and make use of things in Evennia. We also have a good idea of the type of game we want. 
Even if this is not the game-style you are interested in, following along will give you a lot of experience 
with using Evennia. This be of much use when doing your own thing later.
