In part three of the Evennia Beginner tutorial we will go through the actual creation of 
our tutorial game _EvAdventure_, based on the [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave)
RPG ruleset. 

This is a big part. You'll be seeing a lot of code and there are plenty of lessons to go through. 
Take your time!

If you followed the previous parts of this tutorial you will have some notions about Python and where to 
find and make use of things in Evennia. We also have a good idea of the type of game we will
create.

Even if this is not the game-style you are interested in, following along will give you a lot 
of experience using Evennia and be really helpful for doing your own thing later!

Fully coded examples of all code we make in this part can be found in the 
[evennia/contrib/tutorials/evadventure](../../../api/evennia.contrib.tutorials.evadventure.md) package.
