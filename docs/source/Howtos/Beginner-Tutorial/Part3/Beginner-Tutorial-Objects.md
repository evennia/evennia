# In-game Objects and items

In the previous lesson we established what a 'Character' is in our game. Before we continue 
we also need to have a notion what an 'item' or 'object' is. 

Looking at _Knave_'s item lists, we can get some ideas of what we need to track: 

- `size` - this is how many 'slots' the item uses in the character's inventory.
- `value` - a base value if we want to sell or buy the item. 
- `inventory_use_slot` - some items can be worn or wielded. For example, a helmet needs to be  worn on the head and a shield in the shield hand. Some items can't be used this way at all, but  only belong in the backpack.
- `obj_type` - Which 'type' of item this is.
  

## New Enums 

We added a few enumberations for Abilities back in the [Utilities tutorial](./Beginner-Tutorial-Utilities.md).
Before we continue, let's expand with enums for use-slots and object types.

```python
# mygame/evadventure/enums.py

# ...

class WieldLocation(Enum):
    
    BACKPACK = "backpack"
    WEAPON_HAND = "weapon_hand"
    SHIELD_HAND = "shield_hand"
    TWO_HANDS = "two_handed_weapons"
    BODY = "body"  # armor
    HEAD = "head"  # helmets

class ObjType(Enum):
    
    WEAPON = "weapon"
    ARMOR = "armor"
    SHIELD = "shield"
    HELMET = "helmet"
    CONSUMABLE = "consumable"
    GEAR = "gear"
    MAGIC = "magic"
    QUEST = "quest"
    TREASURE = "treasure"
```

Once we have these enums, we will use them for referencing things.

## The base object

> Create a new module `mygame/evadventure/objects.py`

```{sidebar}
[evennia/contrib/tutorials/evadventure/objects.py](../../../api/evennia.contrib.tutorials.evadventure.objects.md) has 
a full set of objects implemented.
```
<div style="clear: right;"></div>

We will make a base `EvAdventureObject` class off Evennia's standard `DefaultObject`. We will then add child classes to represent the relevant types: 

```python 
# mygame/evadventure/objects.py

from evennia import AttributeProperty, DefaultObject 
from evennia.utils.utils import make_iter
from .utils import get_obj_stats 
from .enums import WieldLocation, ObjType


class EvAdventureObject(DefaultObject): 
    """ 
    Base for all evadventure objects. 
    
    """ 
    inventory_use_slot = WieldLocation.BACKPACK
    size = AttributeProperty(1, autocreate=False)
    value = AttributeProperty(0, autocreate=False)
    
    # this can be either a single type or a list of types (for objects able to be 
    # act as multiple). This is used to tag this object during creation.
    obj_type = ObjType.GEAR

    # default evennia hooks

    def at_object_creation(self): 
        """Called when this object is first created. We convert the .obj_type 
        property to a database tag."""
        
        for obj_type in make_iter(self.obj_type):
            self.tags.add(self.obj_type.value, category="obj_type")

    def get_display_header(self, looker, **kwargs):
	    """The top of the description""" 
	    return "" 

	def get_display_desc(self, looker, **kwargs):
		"""The main display - show object stats""" 
		return get_obj_stats(self, owner=looker)

    # custom evadventure methods

	def has_obj_type(self, objtype): 
		"""Check if object is of a certain type""" 
		return objtype.value in make_iter(self.obj_type)

    def at_pre_use(self, *args, **kwargs): 
        """Called before use. If returning False, can't be used""" 
        return True 

	def use(self, *args, **kwargs): 
		"""Use this object, whatever that means""" 
		pass 

    def post_use(self, *args, **kwargs): 
	    """Always called after use.""" 
	    pass

    def get_help(self):
        """Get any help text for this item"""
        return "No help for this item"
```

### Using Attributes or not

In theory, `size` and `value` does not change and _could_ also be just set as a regular Python 
property on the class: 

```python 
class EvAdventureObject(DefaultObject):
    inventory_use_slot = WieldLocation.BACKPACK 
    size = 1 
    value = 0 
```

The problem with this is that if we want to make a new object of `size 3` and `value 20`, we have to  make a new class for it. We can't change it on the fly because the change would only be in memory and  be lost on next server reload. 

Because we use `AttributeProperties`, we can set `size` and `value` to whatever we like when we  create the object (or later), and the Attributes will remember our changes to that object indefinitely.

To make this a little more efficient, we use `autocreate=False`. Normally when you create a new object with defined `AttributeProperties`, a matching `Attribute` is immediately created at  the same time. So normally, the object would be created along with two Attributes `size` and `value`. With `autocreate=False`, no Attribute will be created _unless the default is changed_. That is, as  long as your object has `size=1` no database `Attribute` will be created at all. This saves time and  resources when creating large number of objects.

The drawback is that since no Attribute is created you can't refer to it with `obj.db.size` or `obj.attributes.get("size")` _unless you change its default_. You also can't query  the database for all objects with `size=1`, since most objects would not yet have an in-database
`size` Attribute to search for.

In our case, we'll only refer to these properties as `obj.size` etc, and have no need to find 
all objects of a particular size. So we should be safe.

### Creating tags in `at_object_creation`

The `at_object_creation` is a method Evennia calls on every child of `DefaultObject` whenever it is first created. 

We do a tricky thing here, converting our `.obj_type` to one or more [Tags](../../../Components/Tags.md). Tagging the  object like this means you can later efficiently find all objects of a given type (or combination of 
types) with Evennia's search functions:

```python
    from .enums import ObjType 
    from evennia.utils import search 
    
    # get all shields in the game
    all_shields = search.search_object_by_tag(ObjType.SHIELD.value, category="obj_type")
```

We allow `.obj_type` to be given as a single value or a list of values. We use `make_iter` from the  evennia utility library to make sure we don't balk at either. This means you could have a Shield that  is also Magical, for example.

## Other object types 

Some of the other object types are very simple so far. 

```python 
# mygame/evadventure/objects.py 

from evennia import AttributeProperty, DefaultObject
from .enums import ObjType 

class EvAdventureObject(DefaultObject): 
    # ... 
    
    
class EvAdventureQuestObject(EvAdventureObject):
    """Quest objects should usually not be possible to sell or trade."""
    obj_type = ObjType.QUEST
 
class EvAdventureTreasure(EvAdventureObject):
    """Treasure is usually just for selling for coin"""
    obj_type = ObjType.TREASURE
    value = AttributeProperty(100, autocreate=False)
    
```

## Consumables 

A 'consumable' is an item that has a certain number of 'uses'. Once fully consumed, it can't be used  anymore. An example would be a health potion.


```python 
# mygame/evadventure/objects.py 

# ... 

class EvAdventureConsumable(EvAdventureObject): 
    """An item that can be used up""" 
    
    obj_type = ObjType.CONSUMABLE
    value = AttributeProperty(0.25, autocreate=False)
    uses = AttributeProperty(1, autocreate=False)
    
    def at_pre_use(self, user, target=None, *args, **kwargs):
        """Called before using. If returning False, abort use."""
		if target and user.location != target.location:
			user.msg("You are not close enough to the target!")
		    return False
		
		if self.uses <= 0:
		    user.msg(f"|w{self.key} is used up.|n")
		    return False

    def use(self, user, *args, **kwargs):
        """Called when using the item""" 
        pass
    
    def at_post_use(self, user, *args, **kwargs):
        """Called after using the item""" 
        # detract a usage, deleting the item if used up.
        self.uses -= 1
        if self.uses <= 0: 
            user.msg(f"{self.key} was used up.")
            self.delete()
```

In `at_pre_use` we check if we have specified a target (heal someone else or throw a fire bomb at an enemy?), making sure we are in the same location. We also make sure we have `usages` left. In `at_post_use` we make sure to tick off usages. 

What exactly each consumable does will vary - we will need to implement children of this class  later, overriding `at_use` with different effects.

## Weapons

All weapons need properties that describe how efficient they are in battle. To 'use' a weapon means to attack with it, so we can let the weapon itself handle all logic around performing an attack. Having the attack code on the weapon also means that if we in the future wanted a weapon doing something special on-attack (for example, a vampiric sword that heals the attacker when hurting the enemy), we could easily add that on the weapon subclass in question without modifying other code.

```python 
# mygame/evadventure/objects.py 

from .enums import WieldLocation, ObjType, Ability

# ... 

class EvAdventureWeapon(EvAdventureObject): 
    """Base class for all weapons"""

    obj_type = ObjType.WEAPON 
    inventory_use_slot = AttributeProperty(WieldLocation.WEAPON_HAND, autocreate=False)
    quality = AttributeProperty(3, autocreate=False)
    
    attack_type = AttributeProperty(Ability.STR, autocreate=False)
    defense_type = AttributeProperty(Ability.ARMOR, autocreate=False)
    
    damage_roll = AttributeProperty("1d6", autocreate=False)


def at_pre_use(self, user, target=None, *args, **kwargs):
       if target and user.location != target.location:
           # we assume weapons can only be used in the same location
           user.msg("You are not close enough to the target!")
           return False

       if self.quality is not None and self.quality <= 0:
           user.msg(f"{self.get_display_name(user)} is broken and can't be used!")
           return False
       return super().at_pre_use(user, target=target, *args, **kwargs)

   def use(self, attacker, target, *args, advantage=False, disadvantage=False, **kwargs):
       """When a weapon is used, it attacks an opponent"""

       location = attacker.location

       is_hit, quality, txt = rules.dice.opposed_saving_throw(
           attacker,
           target,
           attack_type=self.attack_type,
           defense_type=self.defense_type,
           advantage=advantage,
           disadvantage=disadvantage,
       )
       location.msg_contents(
           f"$You() $conj(attack) $You({target.key}) with {self.key}: {txt}",
           from_obj=attacker,
           mapping={target.key: target},
       )
       if is_hit:
           # enemy hit, calculate damage
           dmg = rules.dice.roll(self.damage_roll)

           if quality is Ability.CRITICAL_SUCCESS:
               # doble damage roll for critical success
               dmg += rules.dice.roll(self.damage_roll)
               message = (
                   f" $You() |ycritically|n $conj(hit) $You({target.key}) for |r{dmg}|n damage!"
               )
           else:
               message = f" $You() $conj(hit) $You({target.key}) for |r{dmg}|n damage!"

           location.msg_contents(message, from_obj=attacker, mapping={target.key: target})
           # call hook
           target.at_damage(dmg, attacker=attacker)

       else:
           # a miss
           message = f" $You() $conj(miss) $You({target.key})."
           if quality is Ability.CRITICAL_FAILURE:
               message += ".. it's a |rcritical miss!|n, damaging the weapon."
			   if self.quality is not None:
                   self.quality -= 1
               location.msg_contents(message, from_obj=attacker, mapping={target.key: target})

   def at_post_use(self, user, *args, **kwargs):
       if self.quality is not None and self.quality <= 0:
           user.msg(f"|r{self.get_display_name(user)} breaks and can no longer be used!")
```

In EvAdventure, we will assume all weapons (including bows etc) are used in the same location as the target. Weapons also have a `quality` attribute that gets worn down if the user rolls a critical failure. Once quality is down to 0, the weapon is broken and needs to be repaired. 

The `quality` is something we need to track in _Knave_. When getting critical failures on attacks,  a weapon's quality will go down. When it reaches 0, it will break. We assume that a `quality` of `None` means that quality doesn't apply (that is, the item is unbreakable), so we must consider that when checking.

The attack/defend type tracks how we resolve attacks with the weapon, like `roll + STR vs ARMOR + 10`.

In the `use` method we make use of the `rules` module we [created earlier](./Beginner-Tutorial-Rules.md) to perform all the dice rolls needed to resolve the attack. 

This code requires some additional explanation: 
```python
location.msg_contents(
    f"$You() $conj(attack) $you({target.key}) with {self.key}: {txt}",
    from_obj=attacker,
    mapping={target.key: target},
)
```
`location.msg_contents` sends a message to everyone in `location`. Since people will usually notice if you swing a sword at somone, this makes sense to tell people about. This message should however look _different_ depending on who sees it. 

I should see: 

    You attack Grendel with sword: <dice roll results> 

Others should see 

    Beowulf attacks Grendel with sword: <dice roll results>  

And Grendel should see 

    Beowulf attacks you with sword: <dice roll results>

We provide the following string to `msg_contents`: 
```python 
f"$You() $conj(attack) $You({target.key}) with {self.key}: {txt}"
```

The `{...}` are normal f-string formatting markers like those we have used before. The `$func(...)` bits are [Evennnia FuncParser](../../../Components/FuncParser.md) function calls. FuncParser calls are executed as functions and the result replaces their position in the string. As this string is parsed by Evennia, this is what happens: 

First the f-string markers are replaced, so that we get this: 

```python 
"$You() $cobj(attack) $you(Grendel) with sword: \n rolled 8 on d20 ..."
```

Next the funcparser functions are run: 

 - `$You()` becomes the name or `You` depending on if the string is to be sent to that object or not. It uses the `from_obj=` kwarg to the `msg_contents` method to know this. Since `msg_contents=attacker` , this becomes `You` or `Beowulf` in this example. 
 - `$you(Grendel)` looks for the `mapping=` kwarg to `msg_contents` to determine who should be addressed here. If will replace this with the display name or the lowercase `you`. We have added `mapping={target.key: target}` - that is `{"Grendel": <grendel_obj>}`. So this will become `you` or `Grendel` depending on who sees the string. 
- `$conj(attack)` _conjugates_ the verb depending on who sees it. The result will be `You attack ...` or `Beowulf attacks` (note the extra `s`). 

A few funcparser calls compacts all these points of view into one string! 

## Magic 

In _Knave_, anyone can use magic if they are wielding a rune stone (our name for spell books) in both  hands. You can only use a rune stone once per rest. So a rune stone is an example of a 'magical weapon' that is also a 'consumable' of sorts.


```python 
# mygame/evadventure/objects.py 

# ... 
class EvAdventureConsumable(EvAdventureObject): 
    # ... 

class EvAdventureWeapon(EvAdventureObject): 
    # ... 

class EvAdventureRuneStone(EvAdventureWeapon, EvAdventureConsumable): 
    """Base for all magical rune stones"""
    
    obj_type = (ObjType.WEAPON, ObjType.MAGIC)
    inventory_use_slot = WieldLocation.TWO_HANDS  # always two hands for magic
    quality = AttributeProperty(3, autocreate=False)

    attack_type = AttributeProperty(Ability.INT, autocreate=False)
    defense_type = AttributeProperty(Ability.DEX, autocreate=False)
    
    damage_roll = AttributeProperty("1d8", autocreate=False)

    def at_post_use(self, user, *args, **kwargs):
        """Called after usage/spell was cast""" 
        self.uses -= 1 
        # we don't delete the rune stone here, but 
        # it must be reset on next rest.
        
    def refresh(self):
        """Refresh the rune stone (normally after rest)"""
        self.uses = 1
```

We make the rune stone a mix of weapon and consumable. Note that we don't have to add `.uses`  again, it's inherited from `EvAdventureConsumable` parent. The `at_pre_use` and `use` methods  are also inherited; we only override `at_post_use` since we don't want the runestone to be deleted  when it runs out of uses.

We add a little convenience method `refresh` - we should call this when the character rests, to  make the runestone active again.

Exactly what rune stones _do_ will be implemented in the `at_use` methods of subclasses to this  base class. Since magic in _Knave_ tends to be pretty custom, it makes sense that it will lead to a lot  of custom code.


## Armor 

Armor, shields and helmets increase the `ARMOR` stat of the character. In _Knave_, what is stored is the  defense value of the armor (values 11-20). We will instead store the 'armor bonus' (1-10). As we know,  defending is always `bonus + 10`, so the result will be the same - this means  we can use `Ability.ARMOR` as any other defensive ability without worrying about a special case.

``
```python 
# mygame/evadventure/objects.py 

# ... 

class EvAdventureAmor(EvAdventureObject): 
    obj_type = ObjType.ARMOR
    inventory_use_slot = WieldLocation.BODY 

    armor = AttributeProperty(1, autocreate=False)
    quality = AttributeProperty(3, autocreate=False)


class EvAdventureShield(EvAdventureArmor):
    obj_type = ObjType.SHIELD
    inventory_use_slot = WieldLocation.SHIELD_HAND 


class EvAdventureHelmet(EvAdventureArmor): 
    obj_type = ObjType.HELMET
    inventory_use_slot = WieldLocation.HEAD
``` 

## Your Bare hands 

When we don't have any weapons, we'll be using our bare fists to fight. 

We will use this in the upcoming  [Equipment tutorial lesson](./Beginner-Tutorial-Equipment.md) to represent when you have 'nothing'  in your hands. This way we don't need to add any special case for this.

```python
# mygame/evadventure/objects.py

from evennia import search_object, create_object

_BARE_HANDS = None 

# ... 

class WeaponBareHands(EvAdventureWeapon):
     obj_type = ObjType.WEAPON
     inventory_use_slot = WieldLocation.WEAPON_HAND
     attack_type = Ability.STR
     defense_type = Ability.ARMOR
     damage_roll = "1d4"
     quality = None  # let's assume fists are indestructible ...


def get_bare_hands(): 
    """Get the bare hands""" 
    global _BARE_HANDS
    if not _BARE_HANDS: 
        _BARE_HANDS = search_object("Bare hands", typeclass=WeaponBareHands).first()
    if not _BARE_HANDS:
    	_BARE_HANDS = create_object(WeaponBareHands, key="Bare hands")
    return _BARE_HANDS
```

```{sidebar}
Creating a single instance of something that is used everywhere is called to create a _Singleton_. 
```
Since everyone's empty hands are the same (in our game), we create _one_ `Bare hands` weapon object that everyone shares. We do this by searching for the object with `search_object`  (the `.first()` means we grab the first one even if we should by accident have created multiple hands, see [The Django querying tutorial](../Part1/Beginner-Tutorial-Django-queries.md) for more info). If we find none, we create it. 

By use of the `global` Python keyword, we cache the bare hands object get/create in a module level property `_BARE_HANDS`. So this acts as a cache to not have to search the database more than necessary. 

From now on, other modules can just import and run this function to get the bare hands.

## Testing and Extra credits 

Remember the `get_obj_stats` function from the [Utility Tutorial](./Beginner-Tutorial-Utilities.md) earlier?  We had to use dummy-values since we didn't yet know how we would store properties on Objects in the game. 

Well, we just figured out all we need! You can go back and update `get_obj_stats` to properly read the data  from the object it receives. 

When you change this function you must also update the related unit test - so your existing test becomes a  nice way to test your new Objects as well! Add more tests showing the output of feeding different object-types to `get_obj_stats`.

Try it out yourself. If you need help, a finished utility example is found in [evennia/contrib/tutorials/evadventure/utils.py](get_obj_stats).
