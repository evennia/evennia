<h1>Planning our tutorial game<a class="headerlink" href="#planning-our-tutorial-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Using the general plan from last lesson we’ll now establish what kind of game we want to create for this tutorial.
Remembering that we need to keep the scope down, let’s establish some parameters.
Note that for your own
game you don’t <em>need</em> to agree/adopt any of these. Many game-types need more or much less than this.
But this makes for good, instructive examples.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>To have something to refer to rather than just saying “our tutorial game” over and over, we’ll
name it … <em>EvAdventure</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>We want EvAdventure be a small game we can play ourselves for fun, but which could in principle be expanded
to something more later.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s go with a fantasy theme, it’s well understood.</p></li>
<li><p>We’ll use some existing, simple RPG system.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to be able to create and customize a character of our own.</p></li>
<li><p>We want the tools to roleplay with other players.</p></li>
<li><p>We don’t want to have to rely on a Game master to resolve things, but will rely on code for skill resolution
and combat.</p></li>
<li><p>We want monsters to fight and NPCs we can talk to. So some sort of AI.</p></li>
<li><p>We want to be able to buy and sell stuff, both with NPCs and other players.</p></li>
<li><p>We want some sort of crafting system.</p></li>
<li><p>We want some sort of quest system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s answer the questions from the previous lesson and discuss some of the possibilities.</p>
<div class="section" id="administration">
<h2>Administration<a class="headerlink" href="#administration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="should-your-game-rules-be-enforced-by-coded-systems-by-human-game-masters">
<h3>Should your game rules be enforced by coded systems by human game masters?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-your-game-rules-be-enforced-by-coded-systems-by-human-game-masters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Generally, the more work you expect human staffers/GMs to do, the less your code needs to work. To
support GMs you’d need to design commands to support GM-specific actions and the type of game-mastering
you want them to do. You may need to expand communication channels so you can easily
talk to groups people in private and split off gaming groups from each other. RPG rules could be as simple
as the GM sitting with the rule books and using a dice-roller for visibility.</p>
<p>GM:ing is work-intensive however, and even the most skilled and enthusiastic GM can’t be awake all hours
of the day to serve an international player base. The computer never needs sleep, so having the ability for
players to “self-serve” their RP itch when no GMs are around is a good idea even for the most GM-heavy games.</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum are games with no GMs at all; all gameplay are driven either by the computer
or by the interactions between players. Such games still need an active staff, but nowhere as much active
involvement. Allowing for solo-play with the computer also allows players to have fun when the number of active
players is low.</p>
<p>We want EvAdventure to work entirely without depending on human GMs. That said, there’d be nothing
stopping a GM from stepping in and run an adventure for some players should they want to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-the-staff-hierarchy-in-your-game-is-vanilla-evennia-roles-enough-or-do-you-need-something-else">
<h3>What is the staff hierarchy in your game? Is vanilla Evennia roles enough or do you need something else?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-staff-hierarchy-in-your-game-is-vanilla-evennia-roles-enough-or-do-you-need-something-else" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The default hierarchy is</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Player</span></code>  - regular players</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Player</span> <span class="pre">Helper</span></code>  - can create/edit help entries</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Builder</span></code> - can use build commands</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Admin</span></code> - can kick and ban accounts</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Developer</span></code> - full access, usually also trusted with server access</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is also the <em>superuser</em>, the “owner” of the game you create when you first set up your database. This user
goes outside the regular hierarchy and should usually only.</p>
<p>We are okay with keeping this structure for our game.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-players-be-able-to-post-out-of-characters-on-channels-and-via-other-means-like-bulletin-boards">
<h3>Should players be able to post out-of-characters on channels and via other means like bulletin-boards?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-players-be-able-to-post-out-of-characters-on-channels-and-via-other-means-like-bulletin-boards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Evennia’s <em>Channels</em> are by default only available between <em>Accounts</em>. That is, for players to communicate with each
other. By default, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">public</span></code> channel is created for general discourse.
Channels are logged to a file and when you are coming back to the game you can view the history of a channel
in case you missed something.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; public Hello world!
[Public] MyName: Hello world!   
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>But Channels can also be set up to work between Characters instead of Accounts. This would mean the channels
would have an in-game meaning:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Members of a guild could be linked telepathically.</p></li>
<li><p>Survivors of the apocalypse can communicate over walkie-talkies.</p></li>
<li><p>Radio stations you can tune into or have to discover.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bulletin boards</em> are a sort of in-game forum where posts are made publicly or privately. Contrary to a channel,
the messages are usually stored and are grouped into topics with replies. Evennia has no default bulletin-board
system.</p>
<p>In EvAdventure we will just use the default inter-account channels. We will also not be implementing any
bulletin boards.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building">
<h2>Building<a class="headerlink" href="#building" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="how-will-the-world-be-built">
<h3>How will the world be built?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-will-the-world-be-built" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two main ways to handle this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Traditionally, from in-game with build-commands:  This means builders creating content in their game
client. This has the advantage of not requiring Python skills nor server access. This can often be a quite
intuitive way to build since you are sort-of walking around in your creation as you build it. However, the
developer (you) must make sure to provide build-commands that are flexible enough for builders to be able to
create the content you want for your game.</p></li>
<li><p>Externally (by batchcmds): Evennia’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">batchcmd</span></code> takes a text file with Evennia Commands and executes them
in sequence. This allows the build process to be repeated and applied quickly to a new database during development.
It also allows builders to use proper text-editing tools rather than writing things line-by-line in their clients.
The drawback is that for their changes to go live they either need server access or they need to send their
batchcode to the game administrator so they can apply the changes. Or use version control.</p></li>
<li><p>Externally (with batchcode or custom code): This is the “professional game development” approach. This gives the
builders maximum power by creating the content in Python using Evennia primitives. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">batchcode</span></code> processor
allows Evennia to apply and re-apply build-scripts that are raw Python modules. Again, this would require the
builder to have server access or to use version control to share their work with the rest of the development team.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this tutorial, we will show examples of all these ways, but since we don’t have a team of builders we’ll
build the brunt of things using Evennia’s Batchcode system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-only-privileged-builders-create-things-or-should-regular-players-also-have-limited-build-capability">
<h3>Can only privileged Builders create things or should regular players also have limited build-capability?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-only-privileged-builders-create-things-or-should-regular-players-also-have-limited-build-capability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In some game styles, players have the ability to create objects and even script them. While giving regular users
the ability to create objects with in-built commands is easy and safe, actual code-creation (aka <em>softcode</em> ) is
not something Evennia supports natively. Regular, untrusted users should never be allowed to execute raw Python
code (such as what you can do with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">py</span></code> command). You can
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../Concepts/Soft-Code.html"><span class="doc">read more about Evennia’s stance on softcode here</span></a>. If you want users to do limited scripting,
it’s suggested that this is accomplished by adding more powerful build-commands for them to use.</p>
<p>For our tutorial-game, we will only allow privileged builders to modify the world. The exception is crafting,
which we will limit to repairing broken items by combining them with other repair-related items.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="systems">
<h2>Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="do-you-base-your-game-off-an-existing-rpg-system-or-make-up-your-own">
<h3>Do you base your game off an existing RPG system or make up your own?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-base-your-game-off-an-existing-rpg-system-or-make-up-your-own" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will make use of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.geekguild.com/openadventure/">Open Adventure</a>, a simple ‘old school’ RPG-system
that is available for free under the Creative Commons license. We’ll only use a subset of the rules from
the blue “basic” book. For the sake of keeping down the length of this tutorial we will limit what features
we will include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Only two ‘archetypes’ (classes) - Arcanist (wizard) and Warrior, these are examples of two different play
styles.</p></li>
<li><p>Two races only (dwarves and elves), to show off how to implement races and race bonuses.</p></li>
<li><p>No extra features of the races/archetypes such as foci and special feats. While these are good for fleshing
out a character, these will work the same as other bonuses and are thus not that instructive.</p></li>
<li><p>We will add only a small number of items/weapons from the Open Adventure rulebook to show how it’s done.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-game-mechanics-how-do-you-decide-if-an-action-succeeds-or-fails">
<h3>What are the game mechanics? How do you decide if an action succeeds or fails?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-game-mechanics-how-do-you-decide-if-an-action-succeeds-or-fails" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Open Adventure’s conflict resolution is based on adding a trait (such as Strength) with a random number in
order to beat a target. We will emulate this in code.</p>
<p>Having a “skill” means getting a bonus to that roll for a more narrow action.
Since the computer will need to know exactly what those skills are, we will add them more explicitly than
in the rules, but we will only add the minimum to show off the functionality we need.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-the-flow-of-time-matter-in-your-game-does-night-and-day-change-what-about-seasons">
<h3>Does the flow of time matter in your game - does night and day change? What about seasons?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-the-flow-of-time-matter-in-your-game-does-night-and-day-change-what-about-seasons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most commonly, game-time runs faster than real-world time. There are
a few advantages with this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Unlike in a single-player game, you can’t fast-forward time in a multiplayer game if you are waiting for
something, like NPC shops opening.</p></li>
<li><p>Healing and other things that we know takes time will go faster while still being reasonably ‘realistic’.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The main drawback is for games with slower roleplay pace. While you are having a thoughtful roleplaying scene
over dinner, the game world reports that two days have passed. Having a slower game time than real-time is
a less common, but possible solution for such games.</p>
<p>It is however <em>not</em> recommended to let game-time exactly equal the speed of real time. The reason for this
is that people will join your game from all around the world, and they will often only be able to play at
particular times of their day. With a game-time drifting relative real-time, everyone will eventually be
able to experience both day and night in the game.</p>
<p>For this tutorial-game we will go with Evennia’s default, which is that the game-time runs two times faster
than real time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-you-want-changing-global-weather-or-should-weather-just-be-set-manually-in-roleplay">
<h3>Do you want changing, global weather or should weather just be set manually in roleplay?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-want-changing-global-weather-or-should-weather-just-be-set-manually-in-roleplay" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A weather system is a good example of a game-global system that affects a subset of game entities
(outdoor rooms). We will not be doing any advanced weather simulation, but we’ll show how to do
random weather changes happening across the game world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-you-want-a-coded-world-economy-or-just-a-simple-barter-system-or-no-formal-economy-at-all">
<h3>Do you want a coded world-economy or just a simple barter system? Or no formal economy at all?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-want-a-coded-world-economy-or-just-a-simple-barter-system-or-no-formal-economy-at-all" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will allow for money and barter/trade between NPCs/Players and Player/Player, but will not care about
inflation. A real economic simulation could do things like modify shop prices based on supply and demand.
We will not go down that rabbit hole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-you-have-concepts-like-reputation-and-influence">
<h3>Do you have concepts like reputation and influence?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-have-concepts-like-reputation-and-influence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These are useful things for a more social-interaction heavy game. We will not include them for this
tutorial however.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="will-your-characters-be-known-by-their-name-or-only-by-their-physical-appearance">
<h3>Will your characters be known by their name or only by their physical appearance?<a class="headerlink" href="#will-your-characters-be-known-by-their-name-or-only-by-their-physical-appearance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is a common thing in RP-heavy games. Others will only see you as “The tall woman” until you
introduce yourself and they ‘recognize’ you with a name. Linked to this is the concept of more complex
emoting and posing.</p>
<p>Adding such a system from scratch is complex and way beyond the scope of this tutorial. However,
there is an existing Evennia contrib that adds all of this functionality and more, so we will
include that and explain briefly how it works.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rooms">
<h2>Rooms<a class="headerlink" href="#rooms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>Changing room descriptions for day and night, winder and summer is actually quite easy to do, but looks
very impressive. We happen to know there is also a contrib that helps with this, so we’ll show how to
include that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-the-room-have-different-statuses">
<h3>Should the room have different statuses?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-the-room-have-different-statuses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will have different weather in outdoor rooms, but this will not have any gameplay effect - bow strings
will not get wet and fireballs will not fizzle if it rains.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-objects-be-hidden-in-the-room-can-a-person-hide-in-the-room">

<p>We will not model hiding and stealth. This will be a game of honorable face-to-face conflict.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objects">
<h2>Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="how-numerous-are-your-objects-do-you-want-large-loot-lists-or-are-objects-just-role-playing-props">
<h3>How numerous are your objects? Do you want large loot-lists or are objects just role playing props?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-numerous-are-your-objects-do-you-want-large-loot-lists-or-are-objects-just-role-playing-props" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since we are not going for a pure freeform RPG here, we will want objects with properties, like weapons
and potions and such. Monsters should drop loot even though our list of objects will not be huge.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-each-coin-a-separate-object-or-do-you-just-store-a-bank-account-value">
<h3>Is each coin a separate object or do you just store a bank account value?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-each-coin-a-separate-object-or-do-you-just-store-a-bank-account-value" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since we will use bartering, placing coin objects on one side of the barter makes for a simple way to
handle payments. So we will use coins as-objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-multiple-similar-objects-form-stacks-and-how-are-those-stacks-handled-in-that-case">
<h3>Do multiple similar objects form stacks and how are those stacks handled in that case?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-multiple-similar-objects-form-stacks-and-how-are-those-stacks-handled-in-that-case" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since we’ll use coins, it’s practical to have them and other items stack together. While Evennia does not
do this natively, we will make use of a contrib for this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-an-object-have-weight-or-volume-so-you-cannot-carry-an-infinite-amount-of-them">
<h3>Does an object have weight or volume (so you cannot carry an infinite amount of them)?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-an-object-have-weight-or-volume-so-you-cannot-carry-an-infinite-amount-of-them" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Limiting carrying weight is one way to stop players from hoarding. It also makes it more important
for players to pick only the equipment they need. Carrying limits can easily come across as
annoying to players though, so one needs to be careful with it.</p>
<p>Open Adventure rules include weight limits, so we will include them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-objects-be-broken-can-they-be-repaired">
<h3>Can objects be broken? Can they be repaired?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-objects-be-broken-can-they-be-repaired" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Item breakage is very useful for a game economy; breaking weapons adds tactical considerations (if it’s not
too common, then it becomes annoying) and repairing things gives work for crafting players.</p>
<p>We wanted a crafting system, so this is what we will limit it to - repairing items using some sort
of raw materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-you-fight-with-a-chair-or-a-flower-or-must-you-use-a-special-weapon-kind-of-thing">
<h3>Can you fight with a chair or a flower or must you use a special ‘weapon’ kind of thing?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-you-fight-with-a-chair-or-a-flower-or-must-you-use-a-special-weapon-kind-of-thing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Traditionally, only ‘weapons’ could be used to fight with. In the past this was a useful
simplification, but with Python classes and inheritance, it’s not actually more work to just
let all items in game work as a weapon in a pinch.</p>
<p>So for our game we will let a character use any item they want as a weapon. The difference will
be that non-weapon items will do less damage and also break and become unusable much quicker.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="will-characters-be-able-to-craft-new-objects">
<h3>Will characters be able to craft new objects?<a class="headerlink" href="#will-characters-be-able-to-craft-new-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Crafting is a common feature in multiplayer games. In code it usually means using a skill-check
to combine base ingredients from a fixed recipe in order to create a new item. The classic
example is to combine <em>leather straps</em>, a <em>hilt</em>, a <em>pommel</em> and a <em>blade</em> to make a new <em>sword</em>.
A full-fledged crafting system could require multiple levels of crafting, including having to mine
for ore or cut down trees for wood.</p>
<p>In our case we will limit our crafting to repairing broken items. To show how it’s done, we will require
extra items (a recipe) in order to facilitate the repairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="should-mobs-npcs-have-some-sort-of-ai">
<h3>Should mobs/NPCs have some sort of AI?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-mobs-npcs-have-some-sort-of-ai" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A rule of adding Artificial Intelligence is that with today’s technology you should not hope to fool
anyone with it anytime soon. Unless you have a side-gig as an AI researcher, users will likely
not notice any practical difference between a simple state-machine and you spending a lot of time learning
how to train a neural net.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, we will show how to add a simple state-machine for monsters. NPCs will only be
shop-keepers and quest-gives so they won’t need any real AI to speak of.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="are-npcs-and-mobs-different-entities-how-do-they-differ">
<h3>Are NPCs and mobs different entities? How do they differ?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-npcs-and-mobs-different-entities-how-do-they-differ" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>“Mobs” or “mobiles” are things that move around. This is traditionally monsters you can fight with, but could
also be city guards or the baker going to chat with the neighbor. Back in the day, they were often fundamentally
different these days it’s often easier to just make NPCs and mobs essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>In EvAdventure, both Monsters and NPCs will be the same type of thing; A monster could give you a quest
and an NPC might fight you as a mob as well as trade with you.</p>

<p>We will design a simple quest system to track the status of ongoing quests.</p>

<p>Since Evennia differentiates between <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Sessions</span></code> (the client-connection to the game), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Accounts</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Character</span></code>s, it natively supports multi-play. This is controlled by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MULTISESSION_MODE</span></code>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code>- One Character per Account and one Session per Account. This means that if you login to the same
account from another client you’ll be disconnected from the first. When creating a new account, a Character
will be auto-created with the same name as your Account. This is default mode and mimics legacy code bases
which had no separation between Account and Character.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> - One Character per Account, multiple Sessions per Account. So you can connect simultaneously from
multiple clients and see the same output in all of them.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code> - Multiple Characters per Account, one Session per Character. This will not auto-create a same-named
Character for you, instead you get to create/choose between a number of Characters up to a max limit given by
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MAX_NR_CHARACTERS</span></code> setting (default 1). You can play them all simultaneously if you have multiple clients
open, but only one client per Character.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code> - Multiple Characters per Account, Multiple Sessions per Character. This is like mode 2, except players
can control each Character from multiple clients, seeing the same output from each Character.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will go with a multi-role game, so we will use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MULTISESSION_MODE=3</span></code> for this tutorial.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-does-the-character-generation-work">
<h3>How does the character-generation work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-the-character-generation-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a few common ways to do character generation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Rooms. This is the traditional way. Each room’s description tells you what command to use to modify
your character. When you are done you move to the next room. Only use this if you have another reason for
using a room, like having a training dummy to test skills on, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>A Menu. The Evennia <em>EvMenu</em> system allows you to code very flexible in-game menus without needing to walk
between rooms. You can both have a step-by-step menu (a ‘wizard’) or allow the user to jump between the
steps as they please. This tends to be a lot easier for newcomers to understand since it doesn’t require
using custom commands they will likely never use again after this.</p></li>
<li><p>Questions. A fun way to build a character is to answer a series of questions. This is usually implemented
with a sequential menu.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the tutorial we will use a menu to let the user modify each section of their character sheet in any order
until they are happy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-implement-different-classes-or-races">
<h3>How do you implement different “classes” or “races”?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-you-implement-different-classes-or-races" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The way classes and races work in most RPGs (as well as in OpenAdventure) is that they act as static ‘templates’
that inform which bonuses and special abilities you have. This means that all we need to store on the
Character is <em>which</em> class and <em>which</em> race they have; the actual logic can sit in Python code and just
be looked up when we need it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="if-a-character-can-hide-in-a-room-what-skill-will-decide-if-they-are-detected">
<h3>If a Character can hide in a room, what skill will decide if they are detected?<a class="headerlink" href="#if-a-character-can-hide-in-a-room-what-skill-will-decide-if-they-are-detected" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hiding means a few things.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The Character should not appear in the room’s description / character list</p></li>
<li><p>Others hould not be able to interact with a hidden character. It’d be weird if you could do <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">attack</span> <span class="pre">&lt;name&gt;</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">look</span> <span class="pre">&lt;name&gt;</span></code> if the named character is in hiding.</p></li>
<li><p>There must be a way for the person to come out of hiding, and probably for others to search or accidentally
find the person (probably based on skill checks).</p></li>
<li><p>The room will also need to be involved, maybe with some modifier as to how easy it is to hide in the room.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will <em>not</em> be including a hide-mechanic in EvAdventure though.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-does-the-skill-tree-look-like-can-a-character-gain-experience-to-improve-by-killing-enemies-solving-quests-by-roleplaying">
<h3>What does the skill tree look like? Can a Character gain experience to improve? By killing enemies? Solving quests? By roleplaying?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-the-skill-tree-look-like-can-a-character-gain-experience-to-improve-by-killing-enemies-solving-quests-by-roleplaying" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Gaining experience points (XP) and improving one’s character is a staple of roleplaying games. There are many
ways to implement this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Gaining XP from kills is very common; it’s easy to let a monster be ‘worth’ a certain number of XP and it’s
easy to tell when you should gain it.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaining XP from quests is the same - each quest is ‘worth’ XP and you get them when completing the test.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaining XP from roleplay is harder to define. Different games have tried a lot of different ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>XP from being online - just being online gains you XP. This inflates player numbers but many players may
just be lurking and not be actually playing the game at any given time.</p></li>
<li><p>XP from roleplaying scenes - you gain XP according to some algorithm analyzing your emotes for ‘quality’,
how often you post, how long your emotes are etc.</p></li>
<li><p>XP from actions - you gain XP when doing things, anything. Maybe your XP is even specific to each action, so
you gain XP only for running when you run, XP for your axe skill when you fight with an axe etc.</p></li>
<li><p>XP from fails - you only gain XP when failing rolls.</p></li>
<li><p>XP from other players - other players can award you XP for good RP.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For EvAdventure we will use Open Adventure’s rules for XP, which will be driven by kills and quest successes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="may-player-characters-attack-each-other-pvp">
<h3>May player-characters attack each other (PvP)?<a class="headerlink" href="#may-player-characters-attack-each-other-pvp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Deciding this affects the style of your entire game. PvP makes for exciting gameplay but it opens a whole new
can of worms when it comes to “fairness”. Players will usually accept dying to an overpowered NPC dragon. They
will not be as accepting if they perceive another player is perceived as being overpowered. PvP means that you
have to be very careful to balance the game - all characters does not have to be exactly equal but they should
all be viable to play a fun game with. PvP does not only mean combat though. Players can compete in all sorts of ways, including gaining influence in
a political game or gaining market share when selling their crafted merchandise.</p>
<p>For the EvAdventure we will support both Player-vs-environment combat and turn-based PvP. We will allow players
to barter with each other (so potentially scam others?) but that’s the extent of it. We will focus on showing
off techniques and will not focus on making a balanced game.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-are-the-penalties-of-defeat-permanent-death-quick-respawn-time-in-prison">
<h3>What are the penalties of defeat? Permanent death? Quick respawn? Time in prison?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-penalties-of-defeat-permanent-death-quick-respawn-time-in-prison" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is another big decision that strongly affects the mood and style of your game.</p>
<p>Perma-death means that once your character dies, it’s gone and you have to make a new one.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It allows for true heroism. If you genuinely risk losing your character of two years to fight the dragon,
your triumph is an actual feat.</p></li>
<li><p>It limits the old-timer dominance problem. If long-time players dies occationally, it will open things
up for newcomers.</p></li>
<li><p>It lowers inflation, since the hoarded resources of a dead character can be removed.</p></li>
<li><p>It gives capital punishment genuine discouraging power.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s realistic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Perma-death comes with some severe disadvantages however.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It’s impopular. Many players will just not play a game where they risk losing their beloved character
just like that.</p></li>
<li><p>Many players say they like the <em>idea</em> of permadeath except when it could happen to them.</p></li>
<li><p>It can limit roleplaying freedom and make people refuse to take any risks.</p></li>
<li><p>It may make players even more reluctant to play conflict-driving ‘bad guys’.</p></li>
<li><p>Game balance is much, much more important when results are “final”. This escalates the severity of ‘unfairness’
a hundred-fold. Things like bugs or exploits can also lead to much more server effects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, it’s very common to do hybrid systems. Some tried variations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>NPCs cannot kill you, only other players can.</p></li>
<li><p>Death is permanent, but it’s difficult to actually die - you are much more likely to end up being severely
hurt/incapacitated.</p></li>
<li><p>You can pre-pay ‘insurance’ to magically/technologically avoid actually dying. Only if don’t have insurance will
you die permanently.</p></li>
<li><p>Death just means harsh penalties, not actual death.</p></li>
<li><p>When you die you can fight your way back to life from some sort of afterlife.</p></li>
<li><p>You’ll only die permanently if you as a player explicitly allows it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For our tutorial-game we will not be messing with perma-death; instead your defeat will mean you will re-spawn
back at your home location with a fraction of your health.</p>

<h2>Conclusions<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Going through the questions has helped us get a little bit more of a feel for the game we want to do. There are
many other things we could ask ourselves, but if we can cover these points we will be a good way towards a complete,
playable game!</p>
<p>Before starting to code in earnest a good coder should always do an inventory of all the stuff they <em>don’t</em> need
to code themselves. So in the next lesson we will check out what help we have from Evennia’s <em>contribs</em>.</p>
