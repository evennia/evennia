<br>Getting set up.
- Part 1: [What we have](../Part1/Beginner-Tutorial-Part1-Overview.md)
<br>A tour of Evennia and how to use the tools, including an introduction to Python.
- Part 2: [What we want](../Part2/Beginner-Tutorial-Part2-Overview.md)
<br>Planning our tutorial game and what to think about when planning your own in the future.
- Part 3: [How we get there](../Part3/Beginner-Tutorial-Part3-Overview.md)
<br>Getting down to the meat of extending Evennia to make our game
- **Part 4: [Using what we created](./Beginner-Tutorial-Part4-Overview.md)**
<br>Building a tech-demo and world content to go with our code
- Part 5: [Showing the world](../Part5/Beginner-Tutorial-Part5-Overview.md)
<br>Taking our new game online and let players try it out
```

We now have the code underpinnings of everything we need. We have also tested the various components and has a simple tech-demo to show it all works together. But there is no real coherence to it at this point - we need to actually make a world. In part four we will expand our tech demo into a more full-fledged (if small) game by use of batchcommand and batchcode processors.
