<h1>Online Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#online-setup" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Evennia development can be made without any Internet connection beyond fetching updates. However, at some point, you are likely to want to make your game visible online, either as part of opening it to the public or to allow other developers or beta testers access to it.</p>
<section id="connecting-to-evennia-over-the-internet">
<h2>Connecting to Evennia over the Internet<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-to-evennia-over-the-internet" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Accessing your Evennia server from the outside is not hard on its own. Any issues are usually due to the various security measures of your computer, network, or hosting service. These will generally (and correctly) block outside access to servers on your machine unless you tell them otherwise.</p>
<p>We will start by showing how to host your server on your own local computer. Even if you plan to
host your “real” game on a remote host later, setting it up locally is useful practice. We cover
remote hosting later in this document.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Evennia uses three ports for outward communication. If your computer has a firewall, these should be open for in/out communication (and only these, other ports used by Evennia are internal to your computer only).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4000</span></code>, telnet, for traditional mud clients</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4001</span></code>, HTTP, for the website</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4002</span></code>, websocket, for the web client</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Evennia will by default accept incoming connections on all interfaces (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0.0.0.0</span></code>), so in principle anyone knowing the ports to use and has the IP address to your machine should be able to connect to your game.</p>
<aside class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title">Closing the log view</p>
<p>If you need to close the log-view, use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl-C</span></code>. Use just <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">evennia</span> <span class="pre">--log</span></code> on its own to start tailing the logs again.</p>
</aside>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure Evennia is installed and that you have activated the virtualenv. Start the server with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">evennia</span> <span class="pre">start</span> <span class="pre">--log</span></code>. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--log</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-l</span></code>) will make sure that the logs are echoed to the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you can connect with your web browser to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://localhost:4001</span></code> or, alternatively, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://127.0.0.1:4001</span></code> which is the same thing. You should get your Evennia web site and be able to play the game in the web client. Also check so that you can connect with a mud client to host <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">localhost</span></code>, port <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4000</span></code> or host <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">127.0.0.1</span></code>, port <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4000</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.se/search?q=my+ip">Google for “my ip”</a> or use any online service to figure out what your “outward-facing” IP address is. For our purposes, let’s say your outward-facing IP is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">203.0.113.0</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Next try your outward-facing IP by opening <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://203.0.113.0:4001</span></code> in a browser. If this works, that’s it! Also try telnet, with the server set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">203.0.113.0</span></code> and port <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4000</span></code>. However, most likely it will <em>not</em> work. If so, read on.</p></li>
<li><p>If your computer has a firewall, it may be blocking the ports we need (it may also block telnet overall). If so, you need to open the outward-facing ports to in/out communication. See the manual/instructions for your firewall software on how to do this. To test you could also temporarily turn off your firewall entirely to see if that was indeed the problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Another common problem for not being able to connect is that you are using a hardware router (like a wifi router). The router sits ‘between’ your computer and the Internet. So the IP you find with Google is the <em>router’s</em> IP, not that of your computer. To resolve this you need to configure your router to <em>forward</em> data it gets on its ports to the IP and ports of your computer sitting in your private network. How to do this depends on the make of your router; you usually configure it using a normal web browser. In the router interface, look for “Port forwarding” or maybe “Virtual server”. If that doesn’t work, try to temporarily wire your computer directly to the Internet outlet (assuming your computer has the ports for it). You’ll need to check for your IP again. If that works, you know the problem is the router.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you need to reconfigure a router, the router’s Internet-facing ports do <em>not</em> have to have to have the same numbers as your computer’s (and Evennia’s) ports! For example, you might want to connect Evennia’s outgoing port 4001 to an outgoing router port 80 - this is the port HTTP requests use and web browsers automatically look for - if you do that you could go to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://203.0.113.0</span></code> without having to add the port at the end. This would collide with any other web services you are running through this router though.</p>
</div>
<section id="settings-example">
<h3>Settings example<a class="headerlink" href="#settings-example" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can connect Evennia to the Internet without any changes to your settings. The default settings are easy to use but are not necessarily the safest. You can customize your online presence in your <a class="reference internal" href="Settings.html#settings-file"><span class="std std-ref">settings file</span></a>. To have Evennia recognize changed port settings, you have to do a full <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">evennia</span> <span class="pre">reboot</span></code> to also restart the Portal and not just the Server component.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a simple set of settings, mostly using the defaults. Evennia will require access to five computer ports, of which three (only) should be open to the outside world. Below we
continue to assume that our server address is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">203.0.113.0</span></code>.</p>

<p>The web server is always configured with two ports at a time. The <em>outgoing</em> port (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4001</span></code> by
default) is the port external connections can use. If you don’t want users to have to specify the
port when they connect, you should set this to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">80</span></code> - this however only works if you are not running
any other web server on the machine.</p>
<p>The <em>internal</em> port (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4005</span></code> by default) is used internally by Evennia to communicate between the
Server and the Portal. It should not be available to the outside world. You usually only need to
change the outgoing port unless the default internal port is clashing with some other program.</p>

<p>The websocket-based web client needs to be able to call back to the server, and these settings must be changed for it to find where to look. If it cannot find the server you will get an warning in your browser’s Console (in the dev tools of the browser), and the client will revert to the AJAX-

<p>Once your game is online you should make sure to register it with the <a class="reference external" href="http://games.evennia.com/">Evennia Game Index</a>. Registering with the index will help  people find your server, drum up interest for your game and also shows people that Evennia is being used. You can do this even if you are just starting development - if you don’t give any telnet/web address it will appear as <em>Not yet public</em> and just be a teaser.

<p>The only process missing from all of the above documentation is how to pass verification. This is how Let’s Encrypt verifies that you have control over your domain (not necessarily ownership, it’s Domain Validation (DV)). This can be done either with configuring a certain path on your web server or through a TXT record in your DNS. Which one you will want to do is a personal preference, but can also be based on your hosting choice. In a controlled/cPanel environment, you will most likely have to use DNS verification.</p>

<h2>Hosting Evennia from your own computer<a class="headerlink" href="#hosting-evennia-from-your-own-computer" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>What we showed above is by far the simplest and probably cheapest option: Run Evennia on your own home computer. Moreover, since Evennia is its own web server, you don’t need to install anything extra to have a website.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Free (except for internet costs and the electrical bill).</p></li>
<li><p>Full control over the server and hardware (it sits right there!).</p></li>
<li><p>Easy to set up.</p></li>
<li><p>Suitable for quick setups - e.g. to briefly show off results to your collaborators.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You need a good internet connection, ideally without any upload/download limits/costs.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to run a full game this way, your computer needs to always be on. It could be noisy,
and as mentioned, the electrical bill must be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>No support or safety - if your house burns down, so will your game. Also, you are yourself
responsible for doing regular backups.</p></li>
<li><p>Potentially not as easy if you don’t know how to open ports in your firewall or router.</p></li>
<li><p>Home IP numbers are often dynamically allocated, so for permanent online time you need to set up a DNS to always re-point to the right place (see below). - You are personally responsible for any use/misuse of your internet connection– though unlikely (but not impossible) if running your server somehow causes issues for other customers on the network, goes against your ISP’s terms of service (many ISPs insist on upselling you to a business- tier connection) or you are the subject of legal action by a copyright holder, you may find your main internet connection terminated as a consequence.</p></li>

<h3>Setting up your own machine as a server<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-your-own-machine-as-a-server" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="#connecting-to-evennia-over-the-internet"><span class="std std-ref">The first section</span></a> of this page describes how to do this and allow users to connect to the IP address of your machine/router.</p>
<p>A complication with using a specific IP address like this is that your home IP might not remain the
same. Many ISPs (Internet Service Providers) allocates a <em>dynamic</em> IP to you which could change at
any time. When that happens, that IP you told people to go to will be worthless. Also, that long
string of numbers is not very pretty, is it? It’s hard to remember and not easy to use in marketing
your game. What you need is to alias it to a more sensible domain name - an alias that follows you
around also when the IP changes.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>To set up a domain name alias, we recommend starting with a free domain name from
<a class="reference external" href="https://freedns.afraid.org/">FreeDNS</a>. Once you register there (it’s free) you have access to tens
of thousands domain names that people have “donated” to allow you to use for your own sub domain.
For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strangled.net</span></code> is one of those available domains. So tying our IP address to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strangled.net</span></code> using the subdomain <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">evennia</span></code> would mean that one could henceforth direct people to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://evennia.strangled.net:4001</span></code> for their gaming needs - far easier to remember!</p></li>
<li><p>So how do we make this new, nice domain name follow us also if our IP changes? For this we need
to set up a little program on our computer. It will check whenever our ISP decides to change our IP
and tell FreeDNS that. There are many alternatives to be found from FreeDNS:s homepage, one that
works on multiple platforms is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.inatech.eu/inadyn/">inadyn</a>. Get it from their page or,
in Linux, through something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">apt-get</span> <span class="pre">install</span> <span class="pre">inadyn</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, you login to your account on FreeDNS and go to the
<a class="reference external" href="https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/">Dynamic</a> page. You should have a list of your subdomains. Click
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Direct</span> <span class="pre">URL</span></code> link and you’ll get a page with a text message. Ignore that and look at the URL of
the page. It should be ending in a lot of random letters. Everything after the question mark is your
unique “hash”. Copy this string.</p></li>
<li><p>You now start inadyn with the following command (Linux):</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inadyn</span> <span class="pre">--dyndns_system</span> <span class="pre">default&#64;freedns.afraid.org</span> <span class="pre">-a</span> <span class="pre">&lt;my.domain&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span></code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;my.domain&gt;</span></code> would be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">evennia.strangled.net</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;hash&gt;</span></code> the string of numbers we copied
from FreeDNS. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&amp;</span></code> means we run in the background (might not  be valid in other operating
systems). <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inadyn</span></code> will henceforth check for changes every 60 seconds. You should put the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inadyn</span></code>
command string in a startup script somewhere so it kicks into gear whenever your computer starts.</p>

<h2>Hosting Evennia on a remote server<a class="headerlink" href="#hosting-evennia-on-a-remote-server" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your normal “web hotel” will probably not be enough to run Evennia. A web hotel is normally aimed at
a very specific usage - delivering web pages, at the most with some dynamic content. The “Python
scripts” they refer to on their home pages are usually only intended to be CGI-like scripts launched
by their webserver. Even if they allow you shell access (so you can install the Evennia dependencies
in the first place), resource usage will likely be very restricted. Running a full-fledged game
server like Evennia will probably be shunned upon or be outright impossible.  If you are unsure,
contact your web hotel and ask about their policy on you running third-party servers that will want
to open custom ports.</p>
<p>The options you probably need to look for are <em>shell account services</em>, <em>VPS:es</em> or <em>Cloud
services</em>. A “Shell account” service means that you get a shell account on a server and can log in
like any normal user. By contrast, a <em>VPS</em> (Virtual Private Server) service usually means that you
get <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">root</span></code> access, but in a virtual machine. There are also <em>Cloud</em>-type services which allows for
starting up multiple virtual machines and pay for what resources you use.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Shell accounts/VPS/clouds offer more flexibility than your average web hotel - it’s the ability to
log onto a shared computer away from home.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually runs a Linux flavor, making it easy to install Evennia.</p></li>
<li><p>Support. You don’t need to maintain the server hardware. If your house burns down, at least your
game stays online. Many services guarantee a certain level of up-time and also do regular backups
for you. Make sure to check, some offer lower rates in exchange for you yourself being fully
responsible for your data/backups.</p></li>
<li><p>Usually offers a fixed domain name, so no need to mess with IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p>May have the ability to easily deploy <a class="reference internal" href="Installation-Docker.html"><span class="std std-doc">docker</span></a> versions of evennia
and/or your game.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Might be pretty expensive (more so than a web hotel). Note that Evennia will normally need at
least 100MB RAM and likely much more for a large production game.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux flavors might feel unfamiliar to users not used to ssh/PuTTy and the Linux command line.</p></li>
<li><p>You are probably sharing the server with many others, so you are not completely in charge. CPU
usage might be limited. Also, if the server people decides to take the server down for maintenance,
you have no choice but to sit it out (but you’ll hopefully be warned ahead of time).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Installing Evennia on a remote server<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-evennia-on-a-remote-server" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Firstly, if you are familiar with server infrastructure, consider using [Docker](Running-Evennia-in-
Docker) to deploy your game to the remote server; it will likely ease installation and deployment.
Docker images may be a little confusing if you are completely new to them though.</p>
<p>If not using docker, and assuming you know how to connect to your account over ssh/PuTTy, you should
be able to follow the <a class="reference internal" href="Installation.html"><span class="std std-doc">Setup Quickstart</span></a> instructions normally. You only need Python
and GIT pre-installed; these should both be available on any servers (if not you should be able to
easily ask for them to be installed). On a VPS or Cloud service you can install them yourself as
needed.</p>
<p>If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code> is not available and you can’t get it, you can download it (it’s just a single file)
from <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv">the virtualenv pypi</a>. Using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code> you can
install everything without actually needing to have further <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">root</span></code> access. Ports might be an issue,
so make sure you know which ports are available to use and reconfigure Evennia accordingly.</p>

<h3>Cloud9<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud9" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are interested in running Evennia in the online dev environment <a class="reference external" href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>, you
can spin it up through their normal online setup using the Evennia Linux install instructions. The
one extra thing you will have to do is update <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mygame/server/conf/settings.py</span></code> and add
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WEBSERVER_PORTS</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">[(8080,</span> <span class="pre">4001)]</span></code>. This will then let you access the web server and do everything
else as normal.</p>
<p>Note that, as of December 2017, Cloud9 was re-released by Amazon as a service within their AWS cloud
service offering. New customers entitled to the 1 year AWS “free tier” may find it provides
sufficient resources to operate a Cloud9 development environment without charge.
