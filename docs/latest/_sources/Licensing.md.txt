# Licensing Q&A


Evennia is licensed under the very friendly [BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license) (3-clause) license.  You can find the license as [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) in the Evennia repository's root. It's not long!

**Q: When creating a game using Evennia, what does the license permit me to do with it?**

**A:** It's your own game world to do with as you please! Keep it to yourself or re-distribute it
under another license of your choice - or sell it and become filthy rich for all we care.

**Q: I have modified the Evennia library itself, what does the license say about that?**

**A:** Our license allows you to do whatever you want with your modified Evennia, including
re-distributing or selling it, as long as you include our license and copyright info found in
`LICENSE.txt` along with your distribution.

... Of course, if you fix bugs or add some new snazzy feature we *softly nudge* you to make those
changes available so they can be added to the core Evennia package for everyone's benefit. The
license doesn't *require* you to do it, but that doesn't mean we won't still greatly appreciate it
if you do!

**Q: Can I re-distribute the Evennia server package along with my custom game implementation?**

**A:** Sure. As long as the text in `LICENSE.txt` is included.

**Q: What about Contributions?**

The contributions in `evennia/evennia/contrib` are considered to be released under the same license
as Evennia itself, unless the individual contributor has specifically defined otherwise.
