# How To Contribute And Get Help

## Getting Help 

If you cannot find what you are looking for in the documentation, here's where to go next:

- [The Discussions forums][forum] are great for getting help, starting longer-form discussions, showing off your work or get some input on what you are working on. This is also the place to follow Evennia development.
-  [The Discord server][chat] has a very helpful `#getting-help` channel for both big and small Evennia problems. It allows for more direct discussion. You can also track both the evennia code changes and the discussion forum from discord. 

## Giving Help 

In general, being active and helpful in the [discssion forums][forum] or [discord chat][chat] is already a big help!

If you want to spread the word, consider writing about Evennia on your blog or in your favorite (relevant) forum. Write a review somewhere (good or bad, we like feedback either way). Rate it on listings. Talk about it to your friends ... that kind of thing. 

### Help with Documentation

Evennia is highly dependent on good-quality documentation! 

- [Reporting a Documentation issue][issues] is the easiest way to help out. The more eyes we get on things, the better - if we don't know about the problems, we can't fix them! Even reporting typos is a great help.
- [Contributing directly to the docs](./Contributing-Docs.md) is also possible; you just need a text editor. You can fix issues or even propose a new tutorial! 

### Helping with code

Even if you don't feel confident with tackling a bug or feature, just correcting typos, adjusting formatting or simply *using* the thing and reporting when stuff doesn't make sense helps us a lot!

- [Reporting a code issue or bug][issues] is the easiest way to help out. Don't assume we are aware of a problem - if it's not written down in an issue, the problem will most likely be forgotten. Do this even if you plan to make a _Pull Request_ and fix the issue yourself. 
- [Make a feature request][issues] if you want to see a new Evennia feature. You can also bring it up with the community first so you are sure it's something that would be interesting to be included with Evennia core.
- [Make a Pull Request](Coding/Version-Control.md#contributing-to-evennia) (PR) to fix bugs or new features. Make sure to follow the [Evennia Code-Style guide](Coding/Evennia-Code-Style.md). 
- [The Guide for making an Evennia contrib](Contribs/Contribs-Guidelines.md) outlines how you do to make your own Evennia [contrib](Contribs/Contribs-Overview.md) to distribute with Evennia.

### Helping with Donations

Evennia is a free and open-source project. Any monetary donations you want to offer are _completely voluntary_. While highly appreciated, we don't expect you to donate and don't hide any secret features behind a donation-paywall. Just see it as a way of showing appreciation by dropping a few coins in the cup.

- [Become an Evennia patron][patron]  which donates a (usually small) sum every month to show continued support. 
- [Make a one-time donation][paypal] if a monthly donation is not your thing. This is a PayPal link but you don't need PayPal yourself to use it.
