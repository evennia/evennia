Master file is located at `evennia/evennia/settings_default.py`. Read
its comments to see what each setting does and copy only what you want
to change into `mygame/server/conf/settings.py`.

Example of accessing settings:

```
from django.conf import settings

if settings.SERVERNAME == "Evennia":
    print("Yay!")

Master configuration file for Evennia.

NOTE: NO MODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE MADE TO THIS FILE!

All settings changes should be done by copy-pasting the variable and
its value to <gamedir>/server/conf/settings.py.

Hint: Don't copy&paste over more from this file than you actually want
to change.  Anything you don't copy&paste will thus retain its default
value - which may change as Evennia is developed. This way you can
always be sure of what you have changed and what is default behaviour.
