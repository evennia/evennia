# Client Support Grid

This grid tries to gather info about different MU clients when used with Evennia.
If you want to report a problem, update an entry or add a client, make a
new [documentation issue](github:issue) for it. Everyone's encouraged to report their findings.

## Workarounds for client issues:

### Issue: Telnet NOP displays as spurious character.

Known clients:

* BlowTorch (Andr)
* Mukluk (Andr)

Workaround:

* In-game: Use `@option NOPKEEPALIVE=off` for the session, or use the `/save`
parameter to disable it for that Evennia account permanently.
* Client-side: Set a gag-type trigger on the NOP character to make it invisible to the client.
