```
We now have the code underpinnings of everything we need. We have also tested the various components and has a simple tech-demo to show it all works together. But there is no real coherence to it at this point - we need to actually make a world. In part four we will expand our tech demo into a more full-fledged (if small) game by use of batchcommand and batchcode processors.
