In this first part, we'll focus on what we have out of the box with Evennia. We'll familiarize you with the tools and how to find things that you are looking for. We will also dive into some of the things you'll need to know to utilize the system fully, including giving you a brief rundown of Python concepts. If you are an experienced Python programmer, some sections may feel a bit basic -- yet seeing things in the context of Evennia will still be worthwhile.
