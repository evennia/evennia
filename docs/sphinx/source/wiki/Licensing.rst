Evennia Licence FAQ
===================

Evennia is licensed under the very friendly *Modified Clarified Artistic
License*. You can find the license as ``LICENCE`` in the Evennia root
directory. You can also read the full license file
`here <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/source/browse/LICENSE.txt>`_.

You should read the full license text to know what it says exactly, but
here are some answers to common questions.

Q: When creating a game using Evennia, what does the licence permit me to do with it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** It's your own game world to do with as you please! To summarize,
a MUD world you create using Evennia (i.e. the files you create in
``/game/``) falls under **Â§6** of the license (it's a sort of
"library"). So your game world and all its contents belongs to you (as
it should be). Keep it to yourself or re-distribute it under any license
of your choice - or sell it and become filthy rich for all we care.

Q: I have modified Evennia itself, what does the license say about that?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** The Evennia package itself (i.e. the stuff you download from us)
is referred to as "The Package, Standard version" in the license.

-  If you just fixed a typo or bug, that falls under **Â§2** - that is,
   you don't *have* to do anything to appease the license. Regardless,
   we'd of course appreciate it if you submitted bugs/fixes to us so
   Evennia becomes more complete!.
-  If you made bigger modifications or added new features to the server,
   that's also ok, but falls under **Â§3** - you must make a clear note
   of the changes you did and put those changes into public domain
   (since it's then no longer a "Standard version"). You could also
   contact the Evennia developers to make separate arrangements ... but
   of course, if you plan to add new features to the server, the easiest
   way to do so is to simply become an Evennia developer!

Q: Can I re-distribute the Evennia server package along with my custom game implementation?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** Sure. This is covered in **Â§4** - just package the "Standard
version" (that is, the one you download from us) with your game files.
Also make sure to include the original license and disclaimers and note
where users may get "plain" Evennia should they want to download it of
their own.
