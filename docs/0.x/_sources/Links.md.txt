### Literature

- Richard Bartle *Designing Virtual Worlds*  ([amazon page](http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Virtual-Worlds-Richard-Bartle/dp/0131018167)) - Essential reading for the design of any persistent game
world, written by the co-creator of the original game *MUD*. Published in 2003 but it's still as
relevant now as when it came out. Covers everything you need to know and then some.

  When the rights to Designing Virtual Worlds returned to him, Richard Bartle made the PDF of his Designing Virtual Worlds freely available through his own website ([Designing Virtual Worlds](https://mud.co.uk/dvw/)). A direct link to the PDF can be found [here](https://mud.co.uk/richard/DesigningVirtualWorlds.pdf).
- Zed A. Shaw *Learn Python the Hard way* ([homepage](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)) - Despite
the imposing name this book is for the absolute Python/programming beginner. One learns the language
by gradually creating a small text game! It has been used by multiple users before moving on to
Evennia. *Update: This used to be free to read online, this is no longer the case.*
- David M. Beazley *Python Essential Reference (4th ed)* ([amazon
page](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-David-Beazley/dp/0672329786/)) - Our
recommended book on Python; it not only efficiently summarizes the language but is also an excellent
reference to the standard library for more experienced Python coders.
- Luciano Ramalho, *Fluent Python* ([o'reilly
page](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do)) - This is an excellent book for experienced
Python coders willing to take their code to the next level. A great read with a lot of useful info
also for veteran Pythonistas.
- Richard Cantillon *An Essay on Economic Theory* ([free
pdf](http://mises.org/books/essay_on_economic_theory_cantillon.pdf)) - A very good English
translation of *Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général*, one of the foundations of modern
economic theory. Written in 1730 but the translation is annotated and the essay is actually very
easy to follow also for a modern reader. Required reading if you think of implementing a sane game
economic system.
