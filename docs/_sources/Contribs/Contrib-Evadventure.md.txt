```{warning}
NOTE - this tutorial is WIP and NOT complete yet! You will still learn
things from it, but don't expect perfection.
```

A complete example MUD using Evennia. This is the final result of what is
implemented if you follow [Part 3 of the Getting-Started tutorial](../Howtos/Beginner-Tutorial/Part3/Beginner-Tutorial-Part3-Overview.md).
It's recommended that you follow the tutorial step by step and write your own
code. But if you prefer you can also pick apart or use this as a starting point
for your own game.

## Features

- Uses a MUD-version of the [Knave](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/50827/knave) old-school
  fantasy ruleset by Ben Milton (classless and overall compatible with early
  edition D&D), released under the Creative Commons Attribution (all uses,
  including commercial are allowed
  as long as attribution is given).
- Character creation using an editable character sheet
- Weapons, effects, healing and resting
- Two alternative combat systems (turn-based and twitch based)
- Magic (three spells)
- NPC/mobs with simple AI.
- Simple Quest system.
- Small game world.
- Coded using best Evennia practices, with unit tests.
