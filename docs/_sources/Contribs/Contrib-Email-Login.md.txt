# Email-based login system

Contrib by Griatch, 2012

This is a variant of the login system that asks for an email-address
instead of a username to login. Note that it does not verify the email,
it just uses it as the identifier rather than a username.

This used to be the default Evennia login before replacing it with a
more standard username + password system (having to supply an email
for some reason caused a lot of confusion when people wanted to expand
on it. The email is not strictly needed internally, nor is any
confirmation email sent out anyway).

## Installation

To your settings file, add/edit the line:

```python
CMDSET_UNLOGGEDIN = "contrib.base_systems.email_login.UnloggedinCmdSet"
CONNECTION_SCREEN_MODULE = "contrib.base_systems.email_login.connection_screens"

```

That's it. Reload the server and reconnect to see it.

## Notes:

If you want to modify the way the connection screen looks, point
`CONNECTION_SCREEN_MODULE` to your own module. Use the default as a
guide (see also Evennia docs).
