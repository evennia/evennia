Evennia Setup
-------------

You can find the updated and more detailed version of this page on
https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Getting-Started. You don't
need to make your server visible online during development, you only
need an internet connection for downloading and updating. 


Installation
------------

*  Make sure you have the prerequsites with minimum versions
  listed on https://github.com/evennia/evennia/wiki/Getting-Started:

    - python
    - django
    - twisted + Pillow
    - GIT
    - django-south

* Go to a directory on your harddrive where you want the 'evennia'
  directory to be created, for example mud/.

    cd mud/

* Get a copy of the Evennia source (you should have done this 
  already if you are reading this file):

    git clone https://github.com/evennia/evennia.git
    or 
    git clone git@github.com:evennia/evennia.git

    In the future, do 'git pull' to update the server. 

* Change to the evennia/game directory and run the setup scripts.

    cd evennia/game

    python manage.py

* Edit the new game/settings.py if needed, then run

    python manage.py syncdb


Starting Evennia
----------------

* Start the server with

    python evennia.py -i start

  or run without arguments for a menu of launch options. Make
  sure to create a superuser when asked. The email does not have
  to be a real one for testing (evennia does not check it)

* Start up your MUD client of choice and point it to your server and port 4000.
  If you are just running locally the server name is 'localhost'.

* Alternatively, you can find the web interface and webclient by
  pointing your web browser to http://localhost:8000.

* For superuser access, login with the account and password you provided earlier.
